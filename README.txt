Plant Disease Detection

This is a plant disease detection model is implemented by using various image processing techniques.
This model will classify the plant leaves as healthy or diseased based on the training provided.
It is trained to classify the plant leaves into the following categories:
    Pepper__bell___Bacterial_spot
    Pepper__bell___healthy
    Potato___Early_blight
    Potato___Late_blight
    Potato___healthy
    Tomato_Bacterial_spot
    Tomato_Early_blight
    Tomato_Late_blight
    Tomato_Leaf_Mold
    Tomato_Septoria_leaf_spot
    Tomato_Spider_mites_Two_spotted_spider_mite'
    Tomato__Target_Spot'
    Tomato__Tomato_YellowLeaf__Curl_Virus'
    Tomato__Tomato_mosaic_virus'
    Tomato_healthy

Requirements
    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow
    Keras
    OpenCV

This model can be furthur trained to predict much more diseases by providing the appropriate dataset and increasing the number of classes
It has achieved an accuracy of 92.5% on the validation set and 89.2% on the testing set. 
The accuracy can be furthur improved by feeding much more data to the model during training.
